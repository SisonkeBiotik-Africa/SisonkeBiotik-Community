David Adelani: 
* Working on Lacuna proposal.
* Doing a data collect, 10-11 languages. including isiZulu, Twi, Shona...
* parts of speech.
* Parts of speech tags and CRF sometimes beats neural nets (?)
* See more at the [Lacuna fund channel on slack](https://app.slack.com/client/TP2DZ82DA/C01BQLPPE73/thread/D01DV4FGVGV-1604504990.012400)

Kathleen Siminiyu: 
* Working on education applications it seems. 
* Learning stories in your mother tongue very helpful for education
* Translating stories into dialects from Kenya/Eastern Uganda. 
* Collecting speech sythesis data - similar to speech recognition. 
* largely focused on machine translation and speech recognition dataset. 
* Tunde wants clarification: Kathleen says she is translating from English to local dialects. 
* How to learn updates? Jade suggests sharing the proposal folder, and Masakhane consortium can help. 

Catherine: 
* update about Masakhane Web -  a platform for existing trained models
* Chris Emezue talking about his keyboard project, excited about collaborating. 
* Bonaventure would like help with software engineering on the keyboard project. 

Wilhelmina 
* Wilhelmina Nekoto working on translating historical/cultural data
* languages from Namibia.  Oshiwambo to English and KhoekhoeGowab to English and speech/text.
* translating books at first, but copyright issues. 
* videos also. 

Blessing Sibanda 
* has some contacts from Zambia wanting to join consortium. Not from masakhane.
* Nambya language - lowest of the low resource.
* trying to work with them on a proposal
* Jade says: Can you get them to put their document in the folder for the consortium to understand, budget.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambya_language


Jade: 
* proposal to translate AfricArxiv research papers. 
* 11 languages too high budget. Scaling down to 5 or 6. 
* Two options: 5 or 6 languages big/substantial corpora. 
* OR, smaller corpora, but more languages.
* Which is more useful? 
* Tunde: good question, breadth or depth, what about a middle ground - focus on those with a high population of speakers 
* Jade: lots of data on Swahili already, but the list currently: Zulu, Hausa, Yoruba, Amharic, Oromo, KiSwahili. 
* Other possibilities exist, e.g. Kinyarwanda (not sure how to spell?)
* Aishatu suggests Luganda. Good collaborating partners for that also. 
* Tunde says speech would be really great as well. He might miraculously have $$. 

Kathleen pitching the vision. 
* what would a sustainability structure look like? 
* research angle which would enable getting funding for fellowships/internships. 
* We could conceivably connect people for consulting purposes. Enabling African companies. 
* Startup angle. Productizing and monetizing - how to empower people? Connecting to angel investors.
* Structure/organization - nonprofit? For profit? etc. 
* Tunde: great power, great responsibility.
* Jade: ethics support. Also, not next week, but the week after, a talk focusing on ethics. 
* Jade lies awake at night: how can we do it so that the world cannot exploit/mistreat Africans?
