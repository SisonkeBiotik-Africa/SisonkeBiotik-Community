# 2021 Goals & Milestones
This is a first draft and is constantly in flux. Please contribute your updates and ideas. 

## Goals
- Develop core aspects of community engagement 
- Start first research initiatives 
- Deeply engage and interrogate the colonial influences in the work we do, and then rebuild our priorities from an African-centric base where we are very cogniscent of the related influences. 
- Engage deeply with our ethical positioning in the world and develop a SisonkeBiotik Ethics Charter.
- Further lower the barrier to participation via study groups, meetups (especially in multiple languages e.g. engage directly with francophone community)
