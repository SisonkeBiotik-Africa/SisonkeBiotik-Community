In 2020, we arranged our quarterly milestones around conferences. This was very helpful and allowed us to achieve real heights. In 2021, perhaps we can still use quarterly conference goals as motivation, while still paying attention to greater themes

This is a first draft and is constantly in flux. Please contribute your updates and ideas. 

## Goals

- Deeply engage and interrogate the colonial influences in the work we do, and then rebuild our priorities from an African-centric base where we are very cogniscent of the related influences. 
- Engage deeply with our ethical positioning in the world and develop a Masakhane Ethics Charter.
- Further lower the barrier to participation via study groups, meetups (especially in multiple languages e.g. engage directly with francophone community)
- Get a full publication for the NER work we've been doing. 
- Expand our efforts to speech
- Formalize the organisation in a way that is aligned with our values.
